# An Icosahedral Edge Coloring Problem

![The 2017 Putnam Mathematical Competition Problem A6](https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2017.pdf):
> The 30 edges of a regular icosahedron are distinguished by labeling them 1, 2, . . . , 30. How many different ways are there to paint each edge red, white, or blue such that each of the 20 triangular faces of the icosahedron has two edges of the same color and a third edge of a different color?

While this essentially is a combinatorics problem, linear algebra is employed. $T^2$
