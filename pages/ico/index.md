# An Icosahedral Edge Coloring Problem

[The 2017 Putnam Mathematical Competition Problem A6](https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2017.pdf):
> The 30 edges of a regular icosahedron are distinguished by labeling them 1, 2, . . . , 30. How many different ways are there to paint each edge red, white, or blue such that each of the 20 triangular faces of the icosahedron has two edges of the same color and a third edge of a different color?

This was a side project for Department of Mathematics at HKU, under the supervision of Dr. Y. K. Tai, during the 2023 summer. The interesting aspect of this combinatorics problem is that it employs linear algebra. To see the full video, here is the [link](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Avn9xlJW5s7-gxgMjcc2bBEDUjCz?e=8rL6hX). This video production was created using Manim, a Python library for creating mathematical animations.
