Welcome to my personal webpage, where you can explore my ongoing projects and read my written works.

# About Me

I am Ben, a fresh graduate with a BSc in Mathematics at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I have long been interested in math and physics, and I'm now particularly focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am eager to contribute to the STEM field in meaningful ways. 

# Portfolio

This place contains projects and articles related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Feel free to explore!
