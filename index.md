Welcome to my personal webpage, where you can explore my ongoing projects and read my written works.

# About Me

I am Ben, a fresh graduate with a BSc in Mathematics at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I have long been interested in math and physics, and I'm now particularly focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am eager to contribute to the STEM field in meaningful ways. 

# Portfolio

This place contains projects and articles related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Feel free to explore! 

- [Approximation of Fermi Surface by SVM](https://github.com/benw126/Fermi-Surface-SVM)
- [2D Ising Model Phases Classifier](https://github.com/benw126/Ising-Model-Phases-Classifier-FNN)

# Mathematics Garden

My mathematical works are collected here.

- [Matrix Decomposition Algorithms](https://github.com/benw126/Matrix-Decomposition-Algorithms)
- [An Icosahedral Edge Coloring Problem](./ico.html)

# Teaching

During my free time, I teach high school students in the HKDSE curriculum, focusing on Mathematics, Module 2 and Physics. 

I have made a full set of notes for DSE Mathematics. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in obtaining these notes for free.
